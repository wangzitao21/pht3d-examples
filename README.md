# pht3d-examples

This repository contains a Python project that runs the 13 examples from the PHT3D official tutorial using [Flopy](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy) and [PHT3D](https://www.pht3d.org/) together. The integration is achieved using the [pht3d_fsp](https://github.com/SLS-github/PHT3D-FSP) module developed by Stephan L. Seibert.

Currently, 12 out of the 13 examples run successfully and produce results consistent with the documentation. The 11th example is not yet working correctly.
